    "explanation": "From the given information: (1) At least 5 young teachers are female; (2) At least 6 female teachers are over middle age; (3) At least seven young women are teachers. So we have at least 5 young female teachers + at least 6 older female teachers = at least 11 female teachers who are teachers (either young or older). Therefore option 3, 'There are at least 13 female teachers' cannot be concluded, but option 3 'There are at least 11 young teachers' cannot be concluded either since we only know there are at least 5 young teachers who are female. The correct answer is option 3."

    "explanation": "The apparent discrepancy is that while each loan's monthly payment increased over time (graduated payment plan), the average payment received by MetroBank decreased. The best explanation is that the three companies with the largest loans paid them off early (within three years). Since these were likely the loans with the highest payments, removing them from the calculation would decrease the average payment even though individual remaining loan payments were increasing."

    "explanation": "If sales growth of notebook computers is lower than the company's total sales growth, then notebooks must be representing a decreasing percentage of total sales over time. Option 2 states that the proportion of personal notebook sales has risen from 68% to 72%, which directly conflicts with the given information, since this would require notebook sales to grow faster than total sales."

    "explanation": "The scientists claimed that some well-managed farms can reduce chemical use without reducing yield. The critic argues they chose farms likely to succeed, ignoring failures. However, this misses the scientists' point - they're only claiming that such methods can work in some cases, not that they always work. The critic's rebuttal is irrelevant to the actual claim being made."

    "explanation": "The original statement is a conditional: if you don't want to be caught doing something stupid, then don't do something stupid. Options 0, 1, and 2 all express this same conditional relationship in different forms. Option 3 has a different meaning, suggesting that being caught is a matter of luck rather than a natural consequence of the action."

    "explanation": "Social self-organization is defined as spontaneously established, independently developing/acting, having scale, non-governmental, and moving from disorder to order. Option 0 doesn't fit because it appears to be a regular, planned event organized by a software enterprise rather than a spontaneous, self-organizing group."

    "explanation": "The argument assumes that calculating each chemical's effect individually will protect the waterway. This critically assumes that chemicals don't interact with each other to form harmful compounds, as stated in option 2. If chemicals did interact to form harmful compounds, then individual permits wouldn't ensure protection."

    "explanation": "P argues that support from a political party is necessary for effectiveness. Q counters that their current legislator has party support but isn't effective.

    "explanation": "Willett's main conclusion is that Lopez and Simmons are making a foolish decision by revealing their marriage before being hired, since one will lose their job offer.

    "answer": 0,
    "explanation": "Given: (1) No Erhu performance study → No folk music theory research; (2) Likes national instruments → Studies Erhu; (3) Doesn't like national instruments → Does folk music theory research. From (1), if Xu Ping does folk music theory research, he must study Erhu performance. From (3), if he does folk music theory research, he doesn't like national instruments. But from (2), if he doesn't like national instruments, he won't study Erhu. This creates a contradiction if he does folk music theory research. Therefore, he must study folk music theory."
